                <h1>Sunday Surprise: Melted Delight Saves the Day</h1>
                <p> Several years ago, I arranged a nearly year-long scientific stay in France (extended a few more
                    months
                    due to a COVID outbreak) to collaborate with a prestigious French university. It proved to be a
                    rewarding experience, both professionally and personally. The journey was filled with rich
                    experiences,
                    from encountering new cultures and meeting new people to facing challenges like getting stuck in
                    Switzerland during Christmas due to a worker strike (France, am I right?).</p>

                <p>Here, I'll focus on a simpler story: my first visit to the small town near the university during my
                    first week. With the help of my very kind French supervisor, I'd settled in and begun working at the
                    lab
                    daily. The weekend arrived, and I eagerly awaited the chance to visit the beautiful town of
                    Montbéliard,
                    situated in the eastern French region of Franche-Comté, near Jura.</p>

                <p>Hailing from Tehran, one of the Middle East's most populous cities, I was accustomed to a different
                    pace
                    of life. Tehran is a city that never sleeps, with public transportation available 24/7. Here in
                    Montbéliard, however, things were considerably quieter.</p>

                <p>It was a warm Sunday in July. I left my home, not exactly close to the "centre ville" (city center),
                    to
                    catch a bus. I waited almost an hour, little did I know that weekend buses came only every 3 or 4
                    hours
                    and wouldn't wait for stragglers, no matter how much you run after them. Buses were my only option,
                    forget about subways or trams. So, I decided to walk – not my brightest idea. A few hours later, I
                    reached the centre ville, expecting a bustling scene with people strolling, cafes and restaurants
                    full,
                    reservations needed. Instead, I found an empty town eerily reminiscent of the post-apocalyptic movie
                    "28
                    Days Later." No offense to my French fellows, but raised in a vibrant city like Tehran, I couldn't
                    fathom it. My plan to grab some groceries went up in smoke faster than a Parisian cigarette.</p>

                <p>But hey, as they say in France, "there's not a cat in the streets" (which perfectly described the
                    situation), the town is still there. Let's explore!</p>

                <div class="video-container">
                    <video controls poster="/assets/videos/mont.jpg">
                        <source src="/assets/videos/mont.webm" type="video/webm">
                        <source src="/assets/videos/mont.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                </div>
                <p class="video-description">Not even a cat &#128514;</p>

                <p>I must admit, the scenery was beautiful, picturesque even. As I walked through the deserted streets,
                    I
                    crossed the only park in town, where, strangely enough, I encountered a family with two kids
                    playing.
                    Following the path beside the beautiful river, with a few boats bobbing near the dock, I reached a
                    parking lot filled with a cluster of vans. To my surprise, people bustled around, buying food,
                    coffee,
                    sweets, baked goods, ice cream, cheese, and a bunch of other delightful things. Thirsty as could be,
                    I
                    was ecstatic to see them for several reasons. I grabbed some juice and immediately hopped in line at
                    a
                    "fromagerie" (cheese shop) to finally try some French cheese. Cheese is my absolute favorite food,
                    and
                    now that I'm no longer in France, I miss their cheese the most (well, almost the most, but that's a
                    story for another day!).</p>

            <div>
                <p>The saleswoman was friendly and helpful, chatting extensively with each customer. Having studied
                    French
                    for almost two years before my trip, I treasured every opportunity to speak with native speakers
                    and
                    challenge
                    myself. By the time it was my turn, I'd discussed my studies, reason for visit, hobbies, and
                    childhood
                    before placing any sort of order. The people in line were surprisingly tolerant of my gibberish
                    – in
                    Iran, I'd be torn to pieces (almost daily at the gas station!).</p>

                <p>We also discussed French cheese at length, but to be honest, I didn't understand half of what she
                    said.
                    This became especially clear when I realized the cheese I bought differed from what I thought
                    I'd
                    ordered. No matter, after all the trouble getting home, when I finally took the cheese out of
                    the
                    bag,
                    it was all melted. In consolation, I discovered that melted brie tastes fantastic!
